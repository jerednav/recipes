<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
  Recipe made perfectly soft chocolate chip cookies. The dough is made with two
  packets of instant pudding mix — an ingredient I had never seen anyone use in
  cookie dough — which seems to give the cookies a softer, more bakery-style
  texture. Think of these as the "soft-baked" style cookies that have a somewhat
  pliable, bendy texture.
